"Roseland Cottage, Woodstock CT",Architecture,icons/roseland-cottage.jpg,"Photo courtesy of Connecticut Office of Tourism.<br><br>With its distinctive pink exterior, Roseland Cottage was built in 1846 as the summer home of wealthy businessman Henry Bowen, his wife Lucy, and their young family in <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/woodstock/' target='blank'>Woodstock, Connecticut</a>. The house is an excellent example of Gothic Revival architecture, which was popular in the mid-1800s and featured elements like steep-pitched roofs, use of pointed arches for doors, windows, and ornamental elements, and decorative cut or pierced wood trim, sometimes referred to as “gingerbread trim.”<br><br>The five-bedroom, 6,000-square-foot house was designed by English-born architect Joseph C. Wells. The estate also includes landscaped grounds and gardens, an ice house, aviary, carriage barn, and the nation’s oldest surviving indoor bowling alley.<br><br>In the 1870s the house and its outbuildings were expanded to accommodate the growing Bowen family and their needs. The larger service areas included a laundry room, butler’s pantry, scullery, and additional bedrooms for live-in staff. In the 1880s the Bowens redecorated the home’s interior, replacing fireplace tiles, adding stained glass in the parlor windows, and installing new carpets and wall coverings in the latest styles.<br><br>In the 1870s the house and its outbuildings were expanded to accommodate the growing Bowen family and their needs.

"Frog Bridge, Willimantic CT",Architecture,icons/frog-bridge.jpg,"Photo courtesy of Connecticut Office of Tourism.<br><br>.This bridge across the Willimantic River might look like any other highway bridge, except for the four giant frogs sitting atop spools of thread at each end. Known officially as the Thread City Crossing, the bridge opened in 2000, replacing an 1857 stone bridge, which is now a pedestrian walkway. The bronze frog sculptures are the work of artist Leo Jensen of Ivoryton, Connecticut, and they commemorate one of the strangest tales from Connecticut’s history—the “Great Windham Frog Fight” or “Battle of the Frogs.”<br><br>Life on the frontier in mid-18th-century Connecticut was dangerous, and the French and Indian War had just broken out. And so it was that when the residents of the village of Windham heard a dreadful cacophony one night in 1754, they were terrified. Some thought the village was under attack; others thought it was the trumpets of Judgment Day. Brave men ventured out and fired their muskets towards the noise.<br><br>As day broke there was quiet, and soon everything was explained. Hundreds of bullfrog corpses littered the ground near a small pond about a mile east of the village. It seems that a summer drought had caused the frogs to battle to the death over the limited water available.<br><br>In the years that followed, the story became very popular, inspiring various songs and works of art, including the current Frog Bridge. In 2002, the Federal Highway Administration awarded the Frog Bridge an honorable mention for Excellence in Highway Design in the category of Historic Preservation.<br><br>Learn more about the <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/bridge-ornaments-help-tell-the-legend-of-the-windham-frog-fight/' target='_blank'>Great Windham Frog Fight</a>.<br><br>Directions to<a href='https://goo.gl/maps/j33q7QzBT8VjLRCV8' target='_blank'> Frog Bridge, South St, Willimantic CT 06226</a>.",,41.7040633,-72.2098182
"Prudence Crandall Museum, Canterbury CT",Freedom,icons/prudence-crandall.jpg,"Prudence Crandall was a Connecticut teacher jailed for teaching African American girls in <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/canterbury/' target='_blank'>Canterbury</a>. Her arrest received national attention and brought greater awareness to the struggle for equality in education.<br><br>Crandall (1803-1890) was born in Rhode Island in 1803 and moved to Canterbury, Connecticut, at age ten. Because her parents were Quakers and had a belief in gender and racial equality, Prudence received an extensive education—one that was not common for girls at that time.<br><br>After completing her education, Prudence opened an all-girls school in Canterbury in 1831, where she educated the daughters of the town’s elite. In 1832, Sarah Harris, a young African American woman approached Crandall about attending and Crandall admitted her. Many parents were furious and withdrew their daughters from the school. The following year, Crandall closed her school to white students and reopened a new one exclusively “for young Ladies and Little misses of color.” It was the first private academy for African American girls and women in New England and Crandall’s students came from nearby states as well as Connecticut.<br><br>In response, the state of Connecticut passed the Black Law in 1833, making it illegal for African Americans to enter the state to receive an education. Crandall continued to teach her students and was jailed and convicted under this law, but on appeal her case was dismissed on a technicality.<br><br>Crandall closed the school in 1834 when it was vandalized by a violent mob. Shortly before the school was attacked, she married abolitionist Baptist minister Calvin Philleo and moved to New York, and later Illinois and Kansas, where she continued to teach and work for social justice. In 1886, Connecticut provided Crandall with a pension, to compensate for the loss of her livelihood.<br><br>Crandall’s effort to provide equal education for African American women in this house was unusual for the early 1800s. Her actions helped solidify attitudes against slavery throughout New England.<br><br>In 1995, Crandall was designated as Connecticut’s <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/state-heroine-prudence-crandall/' target='_blank'>state heroine</a>.

"Candlewood Lake",Leisure,icons/candlewood-lake.jpg,"Photo courtesy of Library of Congress.<br><br>Candlewood Lake, in the towns of Brookfield, Danbury, New Fairfield, New Milford, and Sherman, is Connecticut’s largest lake, but it did not exist before the 1920s. Where the lake stands now was once 5,420 acres of farmland, forests, and the small farming village of Jerusalem. The Rocky River, a tributary of the Housatonic River, passed through the valley and powered small mills beginning in the colonial period.<br><br>On July 15, 1926, Connecticut Light & Power Company’s board of directors approved a plan to build a man-made reservoir for producing electric power. Water from the Housatonic River would be pumped into the reservoir through a thirteen-foot-diameter pipe. When needed, this water would flow back down into a turbine, which produced the electricity. It took Connecticut Light & Power twenty-six months to construct the lake, including building the dam. The project required 4,500 acres of woodland to be hand cleared. Some of the 1,400 laborers—many of them from Maine and Canada—were housed in four temporary work camps built at the site. In addition to the moving of graves and gravestones, approximately one hundred buildings, including schools, houses, barns, and churches were demolished or moved to clear the land.<br><br>On February 25, 1928, water was first pumped into the valley, and by September 29, 1928, the lake was officially complete. Once opened to the public, it became a popular destination for swimmers, boaters, and hikers.<br><br>Learn more <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/creating-candlewood-lake/' target='_blank'>about Candlewood Lake</a> and <a href='http://www.ctvisit.com/listings/candlewood-lake-town-park' target='_blank'>Candlewood Lake Town Park</a>.<br><br>Directions to <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/aNvqqjhAZnaEb71E6' target='_blank'>Candlewood Lake Park, 199 Old Town Park Rd, New Milford, CT 06776</a>.",,41.532885,-73.437502
"Minute Man Statue, Westport CT",Revolution,icons/minute-man.jpg,"The Minute Man Memorial commemorates the final encounter of the 1777 British incursion into Connecticut. On April 25, 1777, when twenty-six British warships anchored off Connecticut and two thousand British troops under General William Tryon, landed at Compo Beach (then part of Fairfield), the local militia was not prepared to mount much resistance. Three days later, however, after the British had raided Danbury and were pushing back towards their ships, the local farmers and businessmen who made up the militia met them in battle. Though the British successfully fought their back to their ships, the resistance they met along the way helped dissuade them from venturing deep into Connecticut again.<br><br>Efforts to create a monument commemorating the Patriot resistance to the British in Westport started around 1903. Six years later, the commission for the statue was awarded to artist Harry Daniel Webster, who modeled the Minute Man in clay in his Westport studio and had it cast in bronze by Tiffany & Co. The Minute Man statue—kneeling, musket at the ready, sleeves pushed up, awaiting the coming British troops—was unveiled on June 17, 1910, the anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill. <br><br>Years later, on May 6, 1957, the Minute Man statue garnered national attention when it was featured in the final episode of the iconic television program, I Love Lucy. In it, Lucy, who chaired Westport’s semi-fictional “Yankee Doodle Day,” accidentally shatters the statue moments before its dedication, and then attempts to stand in—literally—for the statue during the ceremony.<br><br>Learn more about the <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/the-burning-of-danbury/' target='_blank'>British Raid of Danbury</a> and the <a href='https://www.westportct.gov/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=5468' target='_blank'>Minute Man Memorial</a>.<br><br>Directions to <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/j33q7QzBT8VjLRCV8' target='_blank'>Minuteman Statue, 281 Compo Rd S, Westport, CT 06880</a>.",,41.1116845,-73.354656
